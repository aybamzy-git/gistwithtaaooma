        <p style="font-weight: bolder;"> May we get to know you? </p>
        <p> My name is Maryam Apaokagi. I am a comedian known as Taaooma. </p>
        <br/>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;"> Where are you from? </p>
        <p> I am from Kwara State. </p>
        <br/>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;"> What is that one experience that you cannot forget growing up? </p>
        <p> One experience that I cannot forget when I was growing up was when I lost my mum's money and I had to lie to her that somebody snatched the money. I dropped the money in a bushy place and I looked for it, but I could not find it. So I lied. </p>
        <br/>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;"> Have you ever been sexually molested before? </p>
        <p> It wasn't like I was. It was just near. It wanted to happen, but it did not. </p>
        <br/>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;"> Please narrate what happened. </p>
        <p> So, I was sitting at the front with a taxi driver and he was trying to show me his private parts. He was even trying to take me to somewhere isolated so that he could do whatever he wanted to do. He thought that I was a small girl, and I would agree to whatever he wanted to do. But I knew what was going on, so I confronted him and he let me out of the car. </p>
        <br/>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;"> What effect did that kind of experience have on you? </p>
        <p> Well, since I wasn't directly molested, it didn't really do much damage. Ever since then, I just make sure that I'm not alone, I don't go out alone whether it is during the day or at night, and most importantly, pray that these things don't happen. When these things happen, the victim feels broken. To get out of that kind of trauma takes a lot of time and energy, so the best thing is to try as much as possible to avoid it. </p>
