        <div class="story">
  <p> My name is Ebube and I am a comedian. I started doing comedy because I knew that it was my talent. Taaooma really inspired me, though, I've never met her in person. I love her videos, so I made up my mind to start my own.</p>
  <p> I had a few challenges. When I started, people around me thought that I was not funny. They found my videos really boring. And also, I was always tagging @tundeednut and other popular comedians, but no one reposted any. Giving up became an option, but I did not choose it.</p>
  <p> Now, I have learnt to never give up. Just believe in yourself and do it. A lot of people watch my videos now and I'm happy and more inspired to move foward. </p>
