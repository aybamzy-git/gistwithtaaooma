            <p>When I was in elementary school (primary school), I got bullied by my classmates a lot. They insulted me and called me many bad names for no tangible reason. </p>
            <p> I remember one day, I had a lot of classes, so I got really hungry. I was so hungry that I served myself more than I could finish. My teacher insisted that I should finish it, but I was so full.  My classmates saw what happened and started calling me 'generator'. It might sound stupid or funny, but it made me cry a lot.</p>
            <p> I remember another time when me and my classmates were waiting for our teacher to teach whatever subject he needed to teach. The others were playing and gisting, while I was just on my own. I remembered something funny and I started laughing to myself. Then, the next thing I knew, one of my annoying classmates saw me and said that the reason why I was laughing at them was because I thought they had no self respect. I was so pissed off. I was not laughing at anybody and the guy was not making any sense. I didn't say anything. I just sat there, and they were all laughing at me, calling me names. It was really painful, because I was the only one. There was no one to talk to, no one to console me nor to support me.</p>
            <p> I remember everything now and it still hurts. My parents don't even know till date. Although, I learnt a lot from this experience; always stand up for yourself. If they give you what you do not like, do not take it easy. Reject it. </p>
